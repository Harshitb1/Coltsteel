		<!-- by defaukt if u dont specify an action it will take u to the same page again with all fields refreshed and the method is by default get request-->
		<!-- if we use the name tag we will see the data added in the query string ie the url -->
		<!-- hence through this we are giving names to our data so that we can retrieve them later -->

		<!-- labels are imp for accessebility softwares for eg if you have a blind man using ur form his software will look for labels to know wat to fill in -->

		<!-- required attribute is used for making a field in form compulsory but this is browser dependent, chrome will show a pop up of like you cant submit without writing it but we are nt sure how other browsers deals with it -->
